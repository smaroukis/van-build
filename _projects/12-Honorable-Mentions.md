Here is the grave of the projects that didn't make it to the finished build, so that we can remember the time we spent with them.

Honorable mentions:
- Shoji screens
- DIY LiFePO4 battery bank 
- Aluminum overhead cabinet

## Shoji Screens

![](img/shoji-header.png)

The Japanese design aesthetic *would* have been completed by custom hand-built shoji screens. These *would* have provided a barrier between the bed and the shower. I even bought a roll of waterproof washi-esque Dupont house wrap, diligently read Jay van Arsdale's "Shoji: How to Design, Build, and Install Japanese Screens". But in the end there just wasn't enough time.

## DIY Battery Build

I thought I could save a pretty penny by buying the LiFePO4 cells directly from China and adding in my own Battery Management System. 

I went so far as to build battery cases for them, balanced the cells after usage, and installing them. But in the end I couldn't sell a product with such a critical part of the system as a DIY hack, so I eventually purchased batteries from Renogy (see [batteries](batteries)).
