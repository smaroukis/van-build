## Hardwood Floors

The floors were made out of a combination of reclaimed poplar and oak that had been ripped out of the family farm-house, and although it was a lot more work than a standard plywood + vinyl floor installation, in the end they turned out great.

Since they were reclaimed and had their own character (read: warping), I filled in gaps larger than 1/16" with oak shims and then used commercial-grade wood filler to finish it off before applying three coats of glossy polyurethane.

For full details see [Hardwood-Floors](Hardwood-Floors.md).

## Walls and Partition Wall

**Partition Wall**
- a fixed partition wall with double dutch style doors was added for privacy and insulation with access to the cab
- the same cedar planking later used for the ceiling gives a nice continuous visual transition from the ceiling to the floor
- the cab overhead was converted to a large storage area

**Other Walls**
- various spacers and templates were created to fill in the van wall contours 
- carpet was used on the sliding door and trim areas that had more contours than wood could fill
- 1/4" luan painted sheeting was nailed into the furring strips (note electrical had to be completed before this step)
