## Skylight and Fan

**Skylight**

We installed the largest skylight we could find. Installation was tricky, due to the curved roof of the Ford Transit and the location of the skylight required removal of one of the crossmembers. But the views of the stars at night are worth the trouble.

**Fan**

A MaxxAir MaxxFan Deluxe 7000K model was installed which can be opened even during rainy conditions.

For more details on both see [skylight-and-fan](skylight-and-fan.md).

## Ceiling 

The ceiling was made out of the same 1/8" thick cedar tongue and groove strips as the partition wall facing, which allowed the ceiling to flex to the curvature of the van. The front and rear end battens were tricky to install since there aren't van cross members, so some creativity and custom brackets were required.

For more details see [ceiling](ceiling.md).
