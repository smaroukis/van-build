## Plumbing Overview
- undermount fresh water and grey water tank
- fresh water fill: gravity fed fill from the outside 
- sink drains underneath the van and into the grey water tank (pvc routes over drive shaft); similarly for shower (from rear)
- hot water is provided by hydronic heat exchanger which is in series with the van coolant system
- pump switch is easily accessible (pump tends to run since there is no accumulator)
- pex quick connect fittings were used (expensive but allows for easy re-routing)

Shower and Toilet (see next section, [08-Shower-Toilet-Heater](08-Shower-Toilet-Heater.md)):
- toilet is a composting toilet (no plumbing)
- shower is made from a custom stainless steel shower pan and FRP

## Water Tanks and Sensors

A 20 gallon fresh water tank and a 15 gallon greywater tank are both installed underneath the van. The fresh water is filled via a inlet on the driver side of the van - RV style. 

See more in [Water-Tanks-Sensors](Water-Tanks-Sensors.md).

The [Water-Pump](Water-Pump.md) is a 12V Shurflo 4008 without an accumulator due to space constraints. 

The fresh water (cold side only) is filtered through a three stage carbon and ceramic APEC [Water-Filter](Water-Filter.md).

## Hot Water

Hot water is provided by the Isotemp SPA tank, which is plumbed in-line with the van engine coolant system to heat the water via hydronic heat exchange. 

See details in  [Water-Heater](Water-Heater.md)
