On this page you'll find information about the farmhouse sink, kitchen cabinets, induction stove and 12V fridge.

## Kitchen Cabinet and Drawers

The cabinets were custom made from 1/2" and 3/4" baltic birch with a toe kick added for extra space. The drawers were faced with reclaimed 3/4" oak from the farm - planing those old oak boards down was no joke!

See [Kitchen-Cabinet-and-Drawers](Kitchen-Cabinet-and-Drawers) for details.

## Kitchen Countertop, Sink and Faucet

The counter was built out of acacia butcher block, designed around a farmhouse sink. See [Kitchen-Countertop](Kitchen-Countertop) for more details.

The farmhouse sink measured 22 3/8" x 16" x 7 11/16", providing ample space for washing and drying dishes.

## Induction Stove and Fridge

**Induction Stove**

Before buying the stove I did load measurements to confirm that I had enough battery capacity to handle a full day of cooking on the cooktop. The worst case was 60Ah per meal, so 180Ah for a heavy day of usage.

**Fridge**

The fridge is a marine-grade Isotherm Cruise Elegance 130L, which is ample space for a weeks worth of food. The fridge is raised off the floor to provide storage space underneath for camp chairs and the like.
