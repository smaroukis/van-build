Over two years I took an empty Ford Transit cargo van and converted it from bare metal to an off-grid camper van:

</div>

	<img src = "img/final-kitchen.jpg">
	<img src="img/shower-header.jpg">
	<img src = "img/ladder-tire-rack-outside-shower.jpg"> 
</div>

This website has two purposes 1) to document and share the build with others and 2) to eternally enshrine the build, and all the blood sweat and tears that I put into it.

## Thanks

I couldn't have done this without the support of friends and family. Special thanks goes to my partner Midori, my parents, Andy, Jaymi, Takako, Dennis, and Steph (pictures in [Thanks-Gratitude](Thanks-Gratitude.md))

## What I Learned

This project shaped me more than I could've imagined. As Churchill rightly put,

> We shape our ~~buildings~~ van; thereafter it shapes us. 

Some things I learned along the way
- welding
- battery chemistry and testing
- solar design, selection, and charging
- electrical codes for boats (e.g. ABYC) - useful for RVs too
- plumbing - fitting selection, filtration systems
- hydronic heat exchangers 
- 3D modeling in AutoCad
- woodworking - cabinets and drawers
- design process
