Aluminum was used to save weight since hardwood was being used elsewhere in the van, albeit at a significant increase in cost. The 15 series extrusion was fastened together with aluminum angles and button head screws. 

To add various storage compartments, the whole frame was modeled in 3D before making any cuts. A raised platform allowed storage underneath the walk through area.

To finish the frame it was faced with various 1/4" oak strips, 1/2" baltic birch, and 1/8" luan plywood.
