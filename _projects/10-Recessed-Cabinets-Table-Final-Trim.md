## Recessed Cabinet and Table

A key component of the build was storage, so to maximize the space we recessed a cabinet inside of the 5" cavity that exists on the Ford Transit side walls. 

The cabinet itself was a modified Ikea IVAR shelf faced with maple. A drop-table was added that rests on a post attached to the bed frame via a linear bearing.

## Trim Details

Carpet was used on the side and back doors to provide more insulation and give a clean look. 

Entry ways and bed frame were lined with durable oak.

Nautical deck lights were painted black to give a more unique and homey feel than standard puck-lights.
