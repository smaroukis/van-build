## Recessed Cabinet and Table
- recessed into the 5" cavity on the passenger side to allow for more depth of storage
- the cabinet was a modified Ikea IVAR shelf, for modularity (pre drilled shelf holes)
- face framed with maple
- table drops down from the cabinet to rest on a post that moves up and down via a linear bearing on the T-slotted aluminum framing
- see more in [Recessed-Cabinet-and-Table](Recessed-Cabinet-and-Table.md)

## Trim Details
- Carpet was used on the side and back doors to provide more insulation and give a clean look. 
- Entry ways and bed frame were lined with durable oak
- Nautical deck lights were painted black to give a more unique and homey feel than standard puck-lights
- see [Final-Trimmings](Final-Trimmings.md)
