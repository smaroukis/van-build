## Design and Layout

Interior aesthetics are built in a Japanese-farmhouse style with custom woodworking using reclaimed poplar and oak. Accents are generally matte black and wood trimming is done in oak and maple. 

The bed converts into both a table and a walk-through area. During the day, the mattress stores beneath the [Recessed Cabinet](Recessed-Cabinet-and-Table), and the table folds down to create a workspace.

## Features

The bed frame is made out of T-slotted aluminum to maximize the strength-to-weight ratio.

For air heating the gasoline tank's auxiliary fuel port is used to supply a gasoline-fired **Webasto Air Top 2000** (→ [Air-Heating](Air-Heating.md)), and the water heating comes from the van's engine using a 5 Gallon **Isotemp Spa** [Water-Heater](Water-Heater.md). A large **Skylight** (→[Skylight and Fan](Skylight%20and%20Fan.md)) provides privacy and good natural lighting at the same time.

For added traction in the snow and mud, we added the largest All-Terrain tires possible without having to modify the pinch welds, and built a custom traction board mount that bolts onto the **Ladder Rack** (→ [Ladder-Tire-Rack](Ladder-Tire-Rack.md)).
