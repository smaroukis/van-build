## Project Intro - Feature List

See a full table of features in [Feature-List](Feature-List.md).

The van is designed fully off grid with an emphasis on sustainability and safety (i.e., no propane). With a large enough roof area to fit big solar panels, I was able to power a 1500W induction stove off of a 400Ah LiFePO4 battery bank (→ see [Induction-Cooktop](Components/Induction-Cooktop.md) and [Batteries](Components/Batteries.md)). I also added 120V/30A shore power and an Alternator Charger in case the sun isn't shining enough, or it is parked in the shade for an extended period of time. 

The bed frame is made out of T-slotted aluminum to maximize the strength-to-weight ratio.

For air heating the gasoline tank's auxiliary fuel port is used to supply a gasoline-fired Webasto Air Top 2000 (→ [Air-Heating](Components/Air-Heating.md)), and the water heating comes from the van's engine using a 5 Gallon Isotemp Spa [Water-Heater](Components/Water-Heater.md). A large [Skylight and Fan](Components/Skylight%20and%20Fan.md) provides privacy and good natural lighting at the same time. This van is fully trimmed with no exposed metal. 

For added traction in the snow and mud, I added the largest All-Terrain tires I could without having to modify the pinch welds. Traction boards are included for sand dune crawling.  

The full indoor shower can be converted to an outdoor shower when desired.

## Design and Layout

Interior aesthetics are built in a Japanese-farmhouse style with custom woodworking using reclaimed poplar and oak. Unfortunately I didn't have time to make the [Shoji Screens](Shoji%20Screens)
