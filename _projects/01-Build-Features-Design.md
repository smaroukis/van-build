## Project Intro

The van is designed fully off grid with an emphasis on sustainability and safety. With a large enough roof area to fit big solar panels, I was able to power a 1500W induction stove off of a 400Ah LiFePO4 battery bank (→[06-Electrical-Solar-Inverter-Battery-B2B](06-Electrical-Solar-Inverter-Battery-B2B.md)). I also added 120V/30A shore power and an [Alternator-Charger](Alternator-Charger.md)  in case the sun isn't shining enough, or it is parked in the shade for an extended period of time. 

## Features

The bed frame is made out of T-slotted aluminum to maximize the strength-to-weight ratio.

For air heating the gasoline tank's auxiliary fuel port is used to supply a gasoline-fired Webasto Air Top 2000 (→ [Air-Heating](Air-Heating.md)), and the water heating comes from the van's engine using a 5 Gallon Isotemp Spa [Water-Heater](Water-Heater.md). A large Skylight (→[Skylight and Fan](Skylight%20and%20Fan.md)) provides privacy and good natural lighting at the same time. This van is fully trimmed with no exposed metal. 

For added traction in the snow and mud, I added the largest All-Terrain tires I could without having to modify the pinch welds. Traction boards are included for sand dune crawling.  

The full indoor shower can be converted to an outdoor shower when desired.

## Design and Layout

Interior aesthetics are built in a Japanese-farmhouse style with custom woodworking using reclaimed poplar and oak. Unfortunately I didn't have time to make the [Shoji Screens](Shoji%20Screens)
