The Yakima round bars are attached with standoff pipe clamps for Unistrut ([https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/128/1762](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/128/1762) 1 5/16”) with a rating of 50 lbs each. For more storage you can install a longer Yakima Round bar.  There are extra powder coated pipe clamps for if the rack is extended forward. 

Rivet nuts were added to the solar panel aluminum frame for mounting. They attach to the unistrut via a stud and nut (either 5/16 or 3/8) from the interior of the solar panel frame.
