## Summary
- built out of acacia butcher block
- multiple routing bits used to cut out the exact sink shape
- fastened to cabinet via angle brackets


## Installation 

To get the fit to be exact, first I traced out the templates of the sink and stove. Note that the sink is tricky since we need to trace the inner edge. To get this correct an intermediate template was used and trimmed down until it fit exactly. 

> Since the butcher block is 1.5 inches thick, I used a combination of a normal flush router bit and a bottom bear router bit to cut out the exact shape of the sink

With a combination of a jigsaw and two different router bits, we can get a clean cut. The process is as follows:
1. Cut the template out first, this will be what we use as the guide for the flush router bit, so it's edges should be as straight and as clean as possible
2. On the butcher block, rough cut the outline with a jigsaw, but close enough so that the router bit doesn't have to work too hard
3. Use a flush straight cutting router bit with the template to get the top outline
4. Flip the piece over and use the bottom-bearing flush cut router bit, with the bottom bearing following the previously cut "top" side, to get the full clean edge
