The ladder/tire-rack combo was purchased from Aluminess Products, Inc, one of the only companies who makes a no-drill tire rack that mounts to the existing Ford Transit hinges. The traction boards were mounted to the ladder rungs with pipe clamps and some leftover T-slotted aluminum.

The installation is straightforward, but requires some extra hands for positioning the brackets in the right location while holding the door.
