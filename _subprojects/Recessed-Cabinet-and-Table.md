## Design
- recessed into the 5" cavity on the passenger side to allow for more depth of storage
- the cabinet was a modified Ikea IVAR shelf, for modularity (pre drilled shelf holes)
- face framed with maple
- table drops down from the cabinet to rest on a post that moves up and down via a linear bearing on the T-slotted aluminum framing

## Cabinet 

 The cabinet was designed to be on the passenger side in the van cavity, for maximum space. A table folds out from the cabinet for a work station.

The cabinet was mounted into the recess using by first positioning a framing on the left and right, then driving in pocket hole screws on both sides of the cabinets.

## Table 

The table support is a wooden post mounted to a linear bearing that moves up and down along the aluminum extrusion behind. A handle allows for loosening and tightening of the bearing on the extrusion thus fixing it in place.
