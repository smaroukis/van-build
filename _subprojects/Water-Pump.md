The pump is powered through the Tank Sensor & Switch. There is a filter on the tank side. The tubing is vibration-resistant on both the inlet and outlet of the pump, which comes directly from the tank.
Generally it is advised to turn off the shower valves when the shower is not in use (see below)

The pump tees off into three systems: first it feeds the hot water tank, then the cold shower line, then the filter (to the sink). Thus all of the cold water on the sink is filtered, but none of the hot. Many ball valves are provided for maintenance.

Diagram (T-fitting off the hot line to the sink is not shown)
