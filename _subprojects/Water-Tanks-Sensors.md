Mfg. / Part #: Class A Customs 20 Gallon Under Mount Water Tank
Tags: plumbing

The water tanks were mounted underneath the van. The brackets were tricky to install, because of the thickness of the steel frame underneath. 

The fresh water tank piggybacked off of the fuel tank mounting bolt holes on one side and rivet nuts were installed on the other side so that the tank could be removed for cleaning.

> Since it was hard to drill into the thick steel underneath the van, part of the tank frame piggybacked off of the existing fuel tank bolts

The fresh water tank had level probes installed as supplied with the Class A Customs water tank.
