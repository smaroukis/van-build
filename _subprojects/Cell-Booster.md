The cell booster increases cell signal signal from 1 or 2 bars to 3 or 4. The WeBoost is plugged into one of the 120V outlets, but can also be wired directly into 12V (it is a 12V power supply). 

The Antenna is mounted on the [roof-rack](roof-rack) with a Rhino Rack articulating mount, so it can be folded down when not in use. 

The inside repeater is located in the recessed cabinet.
