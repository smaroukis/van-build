Installation is simpler, and one of the first things we did during this project. It's really not as scary as it looks. Steps:
1. Cut the hole the size of the window's see through section (plus room for sliding)
2. Smooth off the raw edges of the cut, prime them and trim with rubber U-channel if desired
3. Apply primer then adhesive
4. Mount and wait 24 hours to cure

The adhesive product used was SikaFlex P2G Automotive Urethane Adhesive. Note on their website they recommend also using a primer for side windows:

*"This Automotive Urethane Adhesive can be used primer-less on Windshields. However; we recommend using a primer on side windows, unlike most windshields side windows are vertical and the primer will make for a quicker bond to the wall of the van for safer installation."*
