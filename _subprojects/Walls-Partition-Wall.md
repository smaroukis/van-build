## Summary

**Partition Wall**
- a fixed partition wall with double dutch style doors was added for privacy and insulation with access to the cab
- the same cedar planking later used for the ceiling gives a nice continuous visual transition from the ceiling to the floor
- the cab overhead was converted to a large storage area

**Other Walls**
- various spacers and templates were created to fill in the van wall contours 
- carpet was used on the sliding door and trim areas that had more contours than wood could fill
- 1/4" luan painted sheeting was nailed into the furring strips (note electrical had to be completed before this step)

## Partition Wall

The partition wall frame is built off part of the metal framing of the van - there are pre-tapped mounting holes, I assume for after market partition wall installers. I extended off of these with 2x2s. 

1/8" thick cedar planking are used for the partition wall facing, and also for the ceilings. It's commonly sold for use in lining closets, since it is bug resistant.

## Walls

The walls were a painted 1/4" luan ply mounted to the furring strips via a nail gun.

## Sliding Door Area

Making the template that was needed to trim up to the edges of the door frame.

For the entry area I knew I wanted to have a clean carpeted appearance with no exposed metal, but it was difficult due to this gap:

The contour was traced out and a wood facing was screwed to the furring strip to give a solid place to adhere carpet. Later the exposed edging would be faced with vinyl U-channel going around all the way around.
